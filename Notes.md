# Ideas for upcoming charts
-> Look for charts that update through time and visibly show change



Plot with correlation of returns over asset classes
- bar chart
- 12 month rolling correlation?
- For each end of month?

Drawdowns
- scatterplot, weekly drawdowns
- Bitcoin only over Time
- Bitcoin compared to other assets

Central Banks
- monthly data?
- balance sheet total assets
- yield curves -> see Lyn Alden tweets

FRED: leverage and margin accounts
- linechart
